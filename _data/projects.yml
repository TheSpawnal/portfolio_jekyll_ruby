    - tag: Shell

- name: Operating Systems
  descr: "This consequent project encompasses four critical areas of operating systems: a shell, a memory allocator, file system management, and concurrency control, implemented on a remote Linux system. It digs into the intricacies of memory management, processes, file systems, and I/O without the use of inter-process communication (IPC), and explores advanced OS concepts such as syscalls, signals, pipes, interrupts, mutual exclusion, semaphores, monitors, read-write locking, segmentation, file system management reliability, FUSE-based file systems, deadlock resolution, I/O device management, Qubes, and virtualization techniques."

- name: Machine Learning; HR Advisory Report
  descr: "This HR Advisory Report (Simulation) employs advanced machine learning techniques, specifically k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) and neural networks, to enhance hiring and personnel strategies. It refines previous explorations based on feedback, methodically selects and validates models using consistent inputs and rigorous hyperparameter tuning targeting over 90% in key performance metrics. The report features comparative visualizations to delineate model performances and explores the chosen modelâ€™s impact on diverse demographic groups, assessing equity and effectiveness in implementation to ensure that recommendations uphold inclusive and practical HR practices."
